# CodePress

### The first real-time code syntax highlighting engine on the web used by Google and Wordpress back in 2006-2008.

CodePress was a source code syntax highlight engine I made as the final
project for my bachelor's degree in Computer Science. At the time, making
a real-time syntax highlighting engine on a browser was a very hard task.
Browsers did not have support for this feature. It was a big hack to make
it work. Today, using modern browsers, this can be accomplished in simpler ways.

For historic purposes only. This code do not work on modern browsers.
