# CodePress

For historic purposes only. This code does not work on modern browsers.

CodePress was a source code syntax highlight engine I made as my final
project for my bachelor's degree in computer science. At the time, making
a real-time syntax highlighting engine on a browser was a hard task. Today,
using modern browsers, this can be accomplished in many simpler ways.
